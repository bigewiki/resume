        Create a page called "resume.html" (and upload it to your public_html folder on nbtl.mesacc.edu)
        * At the top, using headers (center it via a style only), put a name, address and eventually a photo
        * Using proper levels of h1 through h6 put in the following categories (note, you will probably not need beyond an h3)
        o Goals
        o Education
        o Work History
        o Training and Certification
        o Hobbies
        o References 
        * And somewhere on the resume page you must use
        o Ordered List
        o Un-ordered List
        o Paragraph
        o horizontal rule
        o Link back to your index.html page
        o An image centered at the top

        Page must include the validation link (and it must be working for that page) from the template and must validate to HTML 5, and it must be on the nbtl.mesacc.edu site 
        Post the URL (the url, do NOT attach the file or you get NO points!) so that folks can view your resume and make comments.

        As with all assignments, they must be uploaded to the course server (nbtl.mesacc.edu) to be graded.

        Do your own work.
